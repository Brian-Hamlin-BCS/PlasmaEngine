## Overview
Plasma Game engine is a C++ powered 2D and 3D game engine that is designed to be straigt forward yet powerful for all users. Plasma also aims to maintain as much freedom as possible for the engine and tools, this is done by building as many features as possible ourselves without depending on 3rd party libraries.

## Building the engine

  - Install CMake and Node.js
  - Do a recusive clone of the git repo
  - Run init.bat
  - Run GenerateVS2019.bat
  - Open and Build the .sln file located in `Build\Active`

## Key Features

  - Custom Scripting Language called Lightning (a friend called it js mixed with C#)
  - Custom Physics Engine
  - Nested Archetypes (essentially nested prefabs)
  - Custom Shader language
  - One Click Network Replication
  - Scriptable Render Pipeline
